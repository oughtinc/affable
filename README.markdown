**Pre-alpha. Doesn't do anything meaningful yet.**

Topics to explore:
    - Framework that allows automation based on actions or whatever is appropriate.
    - Framework that allows continuous distillation
    - Probably support reflection a la the [Taxonomy](https://ought.org/projects/factored-cognition/taxonomy#reflection)
    - Intercession on scheduling
        - Ideally some support for automation/distillation of scheduling.
    - Internal dialog via message passing
        - Persistent processes
        - Or, auto-replicating processes
            - Only access to the causally "latest" (from the current process' perspective) node
            - or acess to earlier "versions" as well
    - Or, editing versus internal dialog
        - How to handle staleness?
        - Should editing be non-local? If no, what does that mean exactly?
    
    - Intercession on other aspects? (Rendering, Distillation, Automation)
